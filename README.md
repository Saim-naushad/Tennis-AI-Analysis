# Tennis-AI-Analysis

This repository implements a deep learning-based solution for analyzing tennis matches through computer vision. The focus is on detecting tennis court keypoints, tracking players, and detecting ball movement. The results are visualized on a miniaturized court for enhanced analysis.

## Features

- **Court Keypoint Detection**: Detects and maps 14 key points on the tennis court.
- **Player Tracking**: Tracks player movements across frames.
- **Ball Tracking**: Detects and tracks the tennis ball.
- **Mini Court Mapping**: Visualizes player and ball positions on a scaled-down tennis court.
- **Post-Processing**: Refines ball and keypoint predictions using computer vision techniques.

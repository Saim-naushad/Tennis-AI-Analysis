# Tennis-AI-Analysis

This repository implements a deep learning-based solution for analyzing tennis matches through computer vision. The focus is on detecting tennis court keypoints, tracking players, and detecting ball movement. The results are visualized on a miniaturized court for enhanced analysis.

## âœ¨Features

- **Court Keypoint Detection**: Detects and maps 14 key points on the tennis court.
- **Player Tracking**: Tracks player movements across frames.
- **Ball Tracking**: Detects and tracks the tennis ball.
- **Mini Court Mapping**: Visualizes player and ball positions on a scaled-down tennis court.
- **Post-Processing**: Refines ball and keypoint predictions using computer vision techniques.

## ðŸŽ“ Model Training

 ### Keypoint Detection

This model predicts 14 keypoints representing the tennis court's main features. Itâ€™s based on a ResNet-50 architecture, with the last layer adjusted to output 28 values (x, y coordinates for each of the 14 keypoints). Training involves a dataset of tennis court images with annotated keypoints.
To train the keypoint detection model, follow the steps in the `keypoint_training.ipynb notebook`. It walks you through dataset preparation, model training, and saving the weights.

### Ball Detection

The Ball Detection model leverages YOLOv5, for detecting and tracking the tennis ball in video frames. The model is trained on a custom dataset of annotated tennis ball images, enabling it to accurately detect the ball across frames. Training steps are outlined in the `ball_detector_training.ipynb notebook`, which guides you through dataset preparation, model training, and deployment. 

## ðŸš€ Usage

To run the program on your chosen input video, use the following command:

<pre>
<code>
python main.py path_to_input_video.mp4 --output_video output_videos/output_result.avi
</code>
</pre>

- `path_to_input_video.mp4`: Replace this with the path to the video you want to analyze.
 
- `--output_video output_videos/output_result.avi`: This flag specifies where the processed video (with annotations and visualizations) will be saved.

- If you prefer to use a different set of intermediate files or run the process from scratch, you can specify a custom path using the `--stub_path` flag or disable stubs entirely.
